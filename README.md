### Styleguides and Commenting
Styleguides are automatically generated with [sassdown](https://github.com/nopr/sassdown) which parses [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) comments contained in SASS files.

There are two kinds of comments you can use on a project, the first is a SASS comment which will be ignored by SASSDOWN

```
// This is a SASS comment and will be ignored by SASSDOWN

```

The second is a CSS comment and will be used by SASSDOWN in the styleguide documentation

```
/* This is a CSS comment and will be used as documentation for styleguides */

```

### Comment Structure

```
/*

### Placeholder

    <input type="text" placeholder="This is placeholder text">

*/
```
