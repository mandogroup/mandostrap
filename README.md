### Styleguides and Commenting
Styleguides are automatically generated by SASSDOWN by parsing Markdown comments in
all SASS files.

There are two kinds of comments you can use on a project, the first is a SASS comment
which will be ignored by SASSDOWN

```
// This is a SASS comment and will be ignored by SASSDOWN

```

The second is a CSS comment and will be used by SASSDOWN in the styleguide documentation

```
/* This is a CSS comment and will be used as documentation for styleguides */

```

### Comment Structure

```
/*

### Placeholder

    <input type="text" placeholder="This is placeholder text">

*/
```
